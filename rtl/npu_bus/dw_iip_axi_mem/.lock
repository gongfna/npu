error {This workspace has a ".lock" file and may be already in use by another

it is properly closed.

It is possible to have a lock file that does not get removed if the
application did not exit properly. If you believe the workspace is not
in use then click on the remove button to remove the lock file and continue
opening the workspace.

The workspace is in use by:
